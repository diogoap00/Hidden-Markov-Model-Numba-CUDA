# Hidden-Markov-Model-Numba-CUDA

This is a library to work with hidden markov models with discrete or continuous observation space. 
It includes simulation functions, likelihood functions, and 
expectation maximization related functions.

The hmmdisc package is an implementation for discrete observation space and hmmcont is for continuous observation space.


It includes implementations of the algorithm of my paper :
Diogo Pereira, Cl√°udia Nunes, Rui Rodrigues, A new algorithm for inference in HMM's with lower span complexity, Computational Statistics & Data Analysis, 2024.
